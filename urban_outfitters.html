        <h2>An Unlikely Alliance</h2>
        <p>
          Urban Outfitters reaching out to us was unexpected. They're known for
          vintage aesthetics and curated lifestyle branding—not exactly our raw,
          underground vibe. But when their creative director flew out to meet us
          at our studio, something clicked. They weren't looking to change us.
          They were looking for something real to add to their collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          The conversation turned to nostalgia, authenticity, and the way
          vintage clothing tells stories. That's when the Y2K Rewind Pack was
          born—a collaboration that merges Urban Outfitters' aesthetic expertise
          with our uncompromising approach to quality and limited production.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Collaboration Matters</h2>
        <div class="collab-grid">
          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Vintage Done Right</h3>
            <p>
              Urban Outfitters knows vintage aesthetics better than anyone in
              retail. Combined with our proprietary vintage wash process, we
              created pieces that feel authentically worn-in from day one.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Curatorial Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              UO's team helped us refine the Y2K Rewind Pack's presentation—from
              packaging design to in-store displays. They understand that how
              you present vintage-inspired pieces matters as much as the pieces
              themselves.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Limited to 50 Packs</h3>
            <p>
              We insisted on extreme scarcity. Only 50 complete Y2K Rewind Packs
              exist, split between our studio and select Urban Outfitters
              flagship locations.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Collector's Focus</h3>
            <p>
              This collaboration targets serious collectors who appreciate both
              the aesthetic and the story. Each pack comes with archival-quality
              packaging and documentation.

        <h2>The Creative Process</h2>
        <p>
          We spent six months perfecting the Y2K Rewind Pack with Urban
          Outfitters. Their creative team brought decades of experience curating
          vintage pieces, while we brought our obsessive attention to
          construction and limited production philosophy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The collaboration process was iterative. We'd create samples, they'd
          provide feedback on how vintage pieces should feel and age, we'd
          refine the wash process. It took 47 different fabric treatments before
          we landed on the final vintage wash formula—a proprietary blend that
          gives the pieces that authentic '90s streetwear feel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Urban Outfitters also helped us design the packaging. Each Y2K Rewind
          Pack comes in a custom box that feels like opening a time
          capsule—complete with vintage-style patches, a certificate of
          authenticity, and archival tissue paper.

              Y2K Rewind Pack. Each location receives 10 packs total.

        <h2>The Vintage Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Real vintage clothing has soul because it has history. The Y2K Rewind
          Pack captures that essence without the inconsistency of actual vintage
          pieces. Every hoodie has the same perfectly worn-in feel, every tee
          has the same soft hand, every cap has the same authentic fade.
        </p>

        <p>
          Urban Outfitters understood that this wasn't about creating distressed
          clothing—it was about honoring the era when streetwear was still
          underground, still dangerous, still real. They gave us complete
          creative freedom to chase that authenticity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each piece goes through our seven-stage vintage wash process. We
          studied original pieces from the '90s and early 2000s, analyzing how
          they aged, where they faded, how the fabric softened. Then we
          replicated that aging process artificially, but in a way that's
          consistent and intentional.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="collab-section">
        <h2>Retail Reimagined</h2>
        <p>
          What surprised us most about working with Urban Outfitters was their
          willingness to break retail conventions. When we insisted on packaging
          the pieces as complete sets rather than individual items, they didn't
          push back. When we demanded extreme scarcity, they embraced it.
        </p>

        <p>
          They understood that the Y2K Rewind Pack isn't just product—it's a
          statement about how streetwear should be made and sold. Limited,
          intentional, with respect for the culture and the customer.
        </p>

      <section class="collab-section">
        <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
        <p>
          This collaboration with Urban Outfitters opened our eyes to what's
          possible when retail partners truly respect the creative vision. They
          didn't try to scale us up or water us down—they amplified what we
          already were.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're in talks about future collaborations, potentially exploring
          different eras of streetwear history. But whatever we do, it will
          maintain the same principles: extreme scarcity, museum-quality
          presentation, and uncompromising authenticity.
