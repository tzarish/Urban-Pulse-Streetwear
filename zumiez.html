        <h2>The Partnership</h2>
        <p>
          When Zumiez approached us about a collaboration, we were skeptical.
          They're retail, we're underground. They're nationwide, we're
          intentionally small. But after sitting down with their team, we
          realized something: Zumiez has been the bridge between street culture
          and the mainstream for decades. They get it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This collaboration isn't about selling out—it's about reaching the
          kids who can't access our studio in the Fashion District. It's about
          putting real streetwear in the hands of skaters, artists, and misfits
          in every corner of the country. Zumiez gave us the platform while
          respecting our vision. No compromises, no watering down, just pure
          Urban Pulse reaching more people.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="collab-section">
        <h2>Why This Collaboration Matters</h2>
        <div class="collab-grid">
          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Authenticity at Scale</h3>
            <p>
              Zumiez has always supported genuine street brands, not just
              corporate imitations. They gave us complete creative control and
              committed to limited runs in their stores—no mass flooding, just
              intentional drops.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Grassroots Distribution</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of traditional retail, Zumiez let us hand-pick which
              stores would carry the Golden Era Collection. We chose locations
              in cities with real skate culture and authentic street scenes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>Supporting the Community</h3>
            <p>
              A portion of every sale goes directly to local skate parks and
              community art programs. This isn't just business—it's giving back
              to the culture that raised us.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="collab-card">
            <h3>The Golden Era Vision</h3>
            <p>
              The Golden Era Collection was designed specifically for this
              partnership—premium pieces that honor streetwear's roots while
              being accessible through Zumiez's network.
            </p>

      <section class="collab-section">
        <h2>How It Happened</h2>
        <p>
          The collaboration started at a skate demo in Long Beach. Zumiez's
          buying team saw our crew wearing prototypes and approached us on the
          spot. They didn't want to change anything—they wanted to help us reach
          kids who needed what we were making.
        </p>

        <p>
          We spent three months negotiating, making sure we could maintain our
          standards. They agreed to limited quantities, hand-numbered pieces,
          and select store releases. Most importantly, they let us design the
          in-store displays and train their staff on the story behind each
          piece.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result? The Golden Era Collection drops exclusively at 50
          hand-picked Zumiez locations, each store receiving only 2 of each
          piece. When they're gone, they're gone. No restocks, no online
          overflow—just pure scarcity and authenticity.
        </p>

            <h3>Select Store Drops</h3>
            <p>
              Only 50 Zumiez locations nationwide will carry the Golden Era
              Collection. Each store gets 2 pieces per design—first come, first
              served.

            <h3>In-Store Experience</h3>
            <p>
              We designed custom displays and packaging for Zumiez stores. Each
              piece comes with a certificate explaining the collaboration and
              our brand story.

              of future drops.

              This is just the beginning. We're planning seasonal collaborations

              last.

        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>
          The Golden Era Collection represents everything we believe in: quality
          over quantity, story over hype, substance over flash. Working with
          Zumiez allowed us to maintain those values while reaching people who
          might never find our studio.
        </p>

        <p>
          We spent months developing the collection—testing fabrics, refining
          cuts, perfecting the vintage wash process. Zumiez didn't rush us. They
          understood that real quality takes time. When we finally delivered the
          samples, their team understood immediately why we'd taken so long.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every piece in the Golden Era Collection is individually numbered and
          authenticated. Zumiez committed to training their staff on how to
          explain the collection's significance to customers. This isn't just
          retail—it's education.
        </p>

      <section class="collab-section">
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          This partnership with Zumiez proves that mainstream retail and
          underground authenticity don't have to be enemies. With the right
          partner who respects your vision, you can reach more people without
          compromising what makes you special.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're planning more collaborations with Zumiez—seasonal drops,
          exclusive colorways, maybe even collaborative designs where their team
          works directly with ours. But we're keeping it controlled, limited,
          and real. Always.
